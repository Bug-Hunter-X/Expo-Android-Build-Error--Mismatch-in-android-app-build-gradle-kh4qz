This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK and involves a mismatch between the `android/app/build.gradle` file's settings and the project's actual configuration.  It can manifest in various ways, but commonly leads to build failures with messages related to missing dependencies, incorrect package names, or version conflicts. This is often caused by manual modifications to the `build.gradle` file that are not in sync with Expo's expected structure or by using a custom build setup that interferes with Expo's automated processes. The error is subtle because it's not always immediately apparent what part of the `build.gradle` is inconsistent.
