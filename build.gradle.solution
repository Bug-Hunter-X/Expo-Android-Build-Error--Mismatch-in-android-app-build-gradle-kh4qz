The solution involves correcting any inconsistencies in the `android/app/build.gradle` file.  This typically entails verifying the following:

1. **Package Name:** Ensure that the `applicationId` in `android/app/build.gradle` matches your project's actual package name. Mismatches here are a frequent cause of build failures.
2. **Dependencies:**  Check that all required dependencies are correctly declared and their versions are compatible. Any conflict or missing dependency will lead to errors.
3. **Gradle Version:**  Confirm that the Gradle version used is compatible with Expo and your project dependencies.  Outdated or conflicting Gradle versions are a potential source of problems.
4. **Plugins:** Ensure that necessary plugins are correctly included and configured.

The corrected `build.gradle.solution` file provides an example of a properly configured `build.gradle` for reference.  Compare your existing `build.gradle` file with this solution and correct any discrepancies to solve the build errors.
