# Expo Android Build Error: Mismatch in android\/app\/build.gradle

This repository demonstrates a common but hard-to-diagnose build error in Expo's Android build process. The error stems from inconsistencies between the `android/app/build.gradle` file's configuration and the actual project setup.

The problem is subtle and doesn't always produce clear error messages. The build often fails with vague references to missing dependencies, incorrect package names, or version conflicts.

## Reproducing the Error

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Follow the instructions in the `build.gradle` file for creating an inconsistency.
3.  Attempt to run `expo build:android`.

You should observe a build failure with cryptic error messages. 

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that the `android/app/build.gradle` file is consistent with the rest of your project configuration. The `build.gradle.solution` file provides a correct version for comparison.

Key points:

* Avoid manually editing `android/app/build.gradle` unless absolutely necessary.  Let Expo manage this file whenever possible.
* If you must make changes, carefully compare your modifications against a clean copy of the file generated by Expo.
* Double check your project's package name in different locations to ensure consistency.
* Review the error messages closely and check the affected lines in `android/app/build.gradle`.

This example highlights the importance of careful configuration management when working with Expo's Android build system.
